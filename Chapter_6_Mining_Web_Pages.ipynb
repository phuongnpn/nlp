            "AI Agent, hay Tác nhân AI, hiện có thể tự đặt mua đồ trên Internet và giao tới địa chỉ nhà, hoặc hỗ trợ công việc giúp người dùng rảnh tay. - VnExpress\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Tôi yêu cầu Operator, tác nhân AI mới của OpenAI, thực hiện một nhiệm vụ bất khả thi: tìm trứng giá rẻ ở khu phố tôi đang ở\", Geoffrey A. Fowler, cây bút công nghệ kỳ cựu của Washington Post, chia sẻ cuối tháng trước.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trong vòng 10 phút, Operator tự động đặt mua một tá trứng, trả tiền qua thẻ tín dụng của Fowler và yêu cầu giao đến trước cửa nhà.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Không thể tin được, khoa học viễn tưởng đang trở thành hiện thực. AI làm mọi thứ, nhưng tôi không yêu cầu nó mua trứng\", Fowler nói. \"Nó đã 'làm loạn' theo đúng nghĩa, khi tự truy cập và ủy quyền cho thẻ tín dụng mua hàng mà không có sự đồng ý của tôi, với 'thiệt hại' 31,43 USD. Tôi hơi bối rối khi nhận ra việc AI tự quyết định thay con người đã khiến tôi mất tiền thật\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Ra mắt hồi tháng 1, Operator là một trong những Tác nhân AI đầu tiên dành cho người dùng cá nhân với khả năng làm việc độc lập. Thay vì đơn thuần trả lời câu hỏi hoặc tạo hình ảnh như chatbot thông thường, chúng tiến ra thế giới thực bằng cách thực hiện các nhiệm vụ thay con người như đặt mua hàng tạp hóa, gửi tin nhắn hoặc đặt chỗ máy bay, tàu xe.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trước đó, công ty Anthropic giới thiệu phiên bản Computer Use thông qua API vào tháng 10/2024. Hai tháng sau, Google cho biết mô hình Gemini 2.0 \"được thiết kế cho thời đại tác nhân\". Hãng cũng công bố Project Mariner, AI Agent có thể duyệt web và thực hiện các hành động như click vào nút bấm hay điền biểu mẫu.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tại Trung Quốc, một AI Agent có tên Manus đang gây sốt nhờ khả năng tự ra quyết định và được ví như \"khoảnh khắc DeepSeek thứ hai\". Forbes gọi Manus là \"tác nhân AI hoàn toàn tự động đầu tiên trên thế giới\", với khả năng suy nghĩ, lập kế hoạch và thực hiện các nhiệm vụ một cách độc lập như con người. Trong khi các ứng dụng như ChatGPT, Gemini cần dựa vào lời nhắc để thực hiện tuần tự công việc, Manus không chờ hướng dẫn, mà được thiết kế để tự khởi tạo các nhiệm vụ, đánh giá thông tin và điều chỉnh cách tiếp cận một cách năng động.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trở lại với Operator, OpenAI hiện cung cấp AI này dưới dạng \"bản xem trước\" thông qua gói cước ChatGPT Pro giá 200 USD, nhưng đang lên kế hoạch đưa lên các gói dịch vụ khác thời gian tới. Chỉ cần ra lệnh, Tác nhân AI này sẽ truy cập vào website, di chuyển con trỏ như một \"bóng ma\" và thực hiện tác vụ. Đôi khi, nó có thể ngừng lại để đợi lệnh, nhưng hầu hết các bước đều tự thực hiện. Người dùng có thể sẽ chỉ cần ngồi xem AI đang làm gì.\n",
            "\n",
            "Theo OpenAI, Operator tích hợp mô hình mới Computer-Using Agent (CUA). Kết hợp khả năng thị giác của GPT-4o và khả năng suy luận nâng cao thông qua học tăng cường, CUA được đào tạo để tương tác với giao diện người dùng đồ họa (GUI) thông qua phím bấm, menu và văn bản mà mọi người nhìn thấy trên màn hình. Nếu gặp thử thách hoặc lỗi, Operator có thể tận dụng khả năng suy luận của mình để tự sửa lỗi. Khi cần trợ giúp, nó sẽ thông báo \"trao\" lại quyền kiểm soát cho người dùng, giúp đảm bảo trải nghiệm mượt và mang tính cộng tác.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cây bút Victoria Turk của Guardian đã thử khả năng của Operator bằng cách cho phép nó mua hàng tạp hóa và nhận thấy nó \"tốt hơn nhiều so với mong đợi\". Ban đầu, khi ra lệnh, AI của OpenAI sẽ hỏi về cửa hàng hoặc thương hiệu yêu thích. Khi được đề xuất chỉ cần cửa hàng rẻ nhất, AI sẽ tự tìm kiếm, truy cập webiste, lọc sản phẩm theo giá và thêm vào giỏ hàng.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Operator không làm tôi bối rối trước những câu hỏi, thay vào đó sẽ đề xuất dựa trên sở thích. Ngoài sản phẩm yêu cầu mua, nó còn đề xuất thêm các món khác để kết hợp giúp tạo ra nhiều món ăn hơn\", Turk cho biết.\n",
            "\n",
            "Operator cũng đề nghị \"cân nhắc can thiệp\" khi nhập tài khoản thanh toán, dù nó có thể \"chiếm quyền\" để đăng nhập tài khoản đã lưu. OpenAI cho biết Operator làm điều này là để tôn trọng quyền riêng tư và các thông tin nhạy cảm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Turk sau đó cũng yêu cầu Operator mua thêm cá và khoai tây chiên, đặt lịch làm móng, nhưng để nó chạy nền vì bà bận làm việc khác. Các thao tác được AI của OpenAI thực hiện trong chốc lát, gồm cả các khoản thanh toán trước.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tuy nhiên, do vẫn ở giai đoạn thử nghiệm, không phải lúc nào Operator cũng theo ý người dùng. Casey Newton của Platformer cho biết đã thử đặt hàng ở cửa hàng tạp hóa Instacart. Ông mong đợi nó sẽ \"hỏi\" ông một số câu hỏi cơ bản như nơi sống, thường mua gì hay loại nào. AI này không hỏi điều gì, tự truy cập trình duyệt, mở website Instacart, tìm kiếm sữa ở Des Moines, Iowa thay vì nơi ông ở là San Francisco. Nó thậm chí nhập địa chỉ cửa hàng tạp hóa gần chỗ ông làm địa chỉ giao hàng. Ông buộc phải tự can thiệp để mua thứ mình muốn.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Trải nghiệm cho thấy một trong những thiếu sót chính của Operator: nó có thể thao tác trên trình duyệt web, nhưng không dùng web đã được bạn cá nhân hóa\", Newton nói.\n",
            "\n",
            "Theo giới chuyên gia, hiện còn sớm để đánh giá AI Agent sẽ thay đổi cuộc sống của con người thế nào. Nhưng thông qua việc tương tác với trình duyệt và dịch vụ trực tuyến, nó sẽ sớm thay đổi cách một người tương tác trên Internet.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Trước đây bạn chỉ hỏi và AI đưa ra câu trả lời, còn bây giờ bạn đưa ra một vấn đề và AI sẽ giải quyết vấn đề đó với những thứ nó có quyền truy cập\", Thomas Dohmke, CEO GitHub, giải thích trên blog. GitHub đã đưa Copilot dưới dạng AI Agent vào nền tảng của mình, nhưng cũng đang phát triển một sản phẩm với tính tự chủ cao hơn là Project Padawan, tự động thực hiện công việc theo lịch trình thay vì bị giám sát liên tục.\n",
            "\n",
            "Business Insider dẫn lời chuyên gia dự đoán trong tương lai, người dùng không cần truy cập website để đọc tin tức, bởi AI Agent đã làm thay. Nó cũng đề xuất, quyết định và hành động với bất cứ vấn đề gì thực hiện qua Internet, đem lại cho con người một cuộc sống có tổ chức hơn.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hai nhà phân tích Internet hàng đầu Mark Shmulik và Nikhil Devnani của công ty nghiên cứu Bernstein hình dung trong tương lai khi gọi xe, người dùng không bận tâm truy cập vào Uber, Lift hay Waymo mà chỉ muốn tìm chuyến đi nhanh, rẻ và thoải mái nhất. Tác nhân AI sẽ giúp họ thực hiện điều này.\n",
            "\n",
            "Theo hai chuyên gia, website và ứng dụng không biến mất, nhưng sẽ phải chuyển sang trạng thái mới để tương thích AI Agent, hiện được gọi là \"công cụ tổng hợp của tổng hợp nội dung\". Kết quả là, phần lớn cấu trúc Internet hiện tại sẽ thay đổi thời gian tới.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Về lý thuyết, Tác nhân AI rất tuyệt vời vì tự động hóa rất nhiều công việc\", nhà khoa học Gary Marcus, người hoài nghi về các mô hình ngôn ngữ lớn (LLM), nói với Guardian. \"Nhưng tôi không nghĩ chúng sẽ hoạt động đáng tin cậy thời gian tới, và một phần do sự cường điệu liên quan đến chúng\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Càng có nhiều tác nhân tự chủ, rủi ro chúng gây ra càng lớn. Margaret Mitchell, CEO Hugging Face, cho rằng \"hoàn toàn tự chủ có nghĩa là quyền kiểm soát của con người được giao lại cho AI\". Thay vì hoạt động trong ranh giới đã đặt ra, một tác nhân hoàn toàn có thể truy cập những thứ \"nhạy cảm\" mà chủ nhân của chúng không nhận ra, hoặc hành xử theo cách không ngờ tới, nhất là khi chúng có thể tự viết code để thay đổi cấu trúc lệnh.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Sẽ không có vấn đề lớn nếu AI Agent đặt sai đơn hàng, nhưng điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu nó chia sẻ thông tin cá nhân của bạn với website lừa đảo, hay đăng nội dung khủng khiếp trên mạng xã hội dưới tên của bạn?\", bà Mitchell đặt câu hỏi. \"Với nơi làm việc như chính phủ, nó có nguy cơ gây ra tình huống đặc biệt nguy hiểm, như có thể truy cập vào hệ thống chỉ huy tên lửa\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Mitchell khuyến cáo ngày càng nhiều thông tin có sẵn trên Internet không phải là ngôn ngữ của con người, mà là thông tin để Tác nhân AI có thể \"hành động\" trên đó. Bà kỳ vọng các chuyên gia công nghệ, nhà lập pháp và nhà hoạch định chính sách sớm đưa ra các quy định giảm thiểu những nguy cơ kể trên.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dohmke của GitHub cũng đồng tình với lo ngại này. Ông tin thời gian tới, trên các website, khái niệm \"Trang chủ\" sớm biến mất hoặc mất đi tầm quan trọng vì giao diện sẽ được thiết kế dành cho các AI Agent. Các thương hiệu có thể bắt đầu cạnh tranh để lôi kéo sự chú ý của AI là con người.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Một ngày nào đó, AI Agent sẽ thoát khỏi sự giới hạn của máy tính. Chúng ta có thể thấy chúng trên robot hình người, mở ra khả năng hỗ trợ con người dưới dạng vật lý\", Dohmke nói. \"Chúng ta sẽ thấy robot AI giặt quần áo, rửa bát đĩa và làm bữa sáng. Chỉ cần không cho chúng tiếp cận vũ khí\".\n",

            "AI Agent, hay Tác nhân AI, hiện có thể tự đặt mua đồ trên Internet và giao tới địa chỉ nhà, hoặc hỗ trợ công việc giúp người dùng rảnh tay.\n",
            "\"Tôi yêu cầu Operator, tác nhân AI mới của OpenAI, thực hiện một nhiệm vụ bất khả thi: tìm trứng giá rẻ ở khu phố tôi đang ở\", Geoffrey A. Fowler, cây bút công nghệ kỳ cựu của Washington Post, chia sẻ cuối tháng trước.\n",
            "Trong vòng 10 phút, Operator tự động đặt mua một tá trứng, trả tiền qua thẻ tín dụng của Fowler và yêu cầu giao đến trước cửa nhà.\n",
            "\"Không thể tin được, khoa học viễn tưởng đang trở thành hiện thực. AI làm mọi thứ, nhưng tôi không yêu cầu nó mua trứng\", Fowler nói. \"Nó đã 'làm loạn' theo đúng nghĩa, khi tự truy cập và ủy quyền cho thẻ tín dụng mua hàng mà không có sự đồng ý của tôi, với 'thiệt hại' 31,43 USD. Tôi hơi bối rối khi nhận ra việc AI tự quyết định thay con người đã khiến tôi mất tiền thật\".\n",
            "Minh họa AI Agent tự mua sắm. Ảnh: Observer Design\n",
            "Ra mắt hồi tháng 1, Operator là một trong những Tác nhân AI đầu tiên dành cho người dùng cá nhân với khả năng làm việc độc lập. Thay vì đơn thuần trả lời câu hỏi hoặc tạo hình ảnh như chatbot thông thường, chúng tiến ra thế giới thực bằng cách thực hiện các nhiệm vụ thay con người như đặt mua hàng tạp hóa, gửi tin nhắn hoặc đặt chỗ máy bay, tàu xe.\n",
            "Trước đó, công ty Anthropic giới thiệu phiên bản Computer Use thông qua API vào tháng 10/2024. Hai tháng sau, Google cho biết mô hình Gemini 2.0 \"được thiết kế cho thời đại tác nhân\". Hãng cũng công bố Project Mariner, AI Agent có thể duyệt web và thực hiện các hành động như click vào nút bấm hay điền biểu mẫu.\n",
            "Tại Trung Quốc, một AI Agent có tên Manus đang gây sốt nhờ khả năng tự ra quyết định và được ví như \"khoảnh khắc DeepSeek thứ hai\". Forbes gọi Manus là \"tác nhân AI hoàn toàn tự động đầu tiên trên thế giới\", với khả năng suy nghĩ, lập kế hoạch và thực hiện các nhiệm vụ một cách độc lập như con người. Trong khi các ứng dụng như ChatGPT, Gemini cần dựa vào lời nhắc để thực hiện tuần tự công việc, Manus không chờ hướng dẫn, mà được thiết kế để tự khởi tạo các nhiệm vụ, đánh giá thông tin và điều chỉnh cách tiếp cận một cách năng động.\n",
            "Trở lại với Operator, OpenAI hiện cung cấp AI này dưới dạng \"bản xem trước\" thông qua gói cước ChatGPT Pro giá 200 USD, nhưng đang lên kế hoạch đưa lên các gói dịch vụ khác thời gian tới. Chỉ cần ra lệnh, Tác nhân AI này sẽ truy cập vào website, di chuyển con trỏ như một \"bóng ma\" và thực hiện tác vụ. Đôi khi, nó có thể ngừng lại để đợi lệnh, nhưng hầu hết các bước đều tự thực hiện. Người dùng có thể sẽ chỉ cần ngồi xem AI đang làm gì.\n",
            "Theo OpenAI, Operator tích hợp mô hình mới Computer-Using Agent (CUA). Kết hợp khả năng thị giác của GPT-4o và khả năng suy luận nâng cao thông qua học tăng cường, CUA được đào tạo để tương tác với giao diện người dùng đồ họa (GUI) thông qua phím bấm, menu và văn bản mà mọi người nhìn thấy trên màn hình. Nếu gặp thử thách hoặc lỗi, Operator có thể tận dụng khả năng suy luận của mình để tự sửa lỗi. Khi cần trợ giúp, nó sẽ thông báo \"trao\" lại quyền kiểm soát cho người dùng, giúp đảm bảo trải nghiệm mượt và mang tính cộng tác.\n",
            "Thay đổi tương tác trên Internet\n",
            "Cây bút Victoria Turk của Guardian đã thử khả năng của Operator bằng cách cho phép nó mua hàng tạp hóa và nhận thấy nó \"tốt hơn nhiều so với mong đợi\". Ban đầu, khi ra lệnh, AI của OpenAI sẽ hỏi về cửa hàng hoặc thương hiệu yêu thích. Khi được đề xuất chỉ cần cửa hàng rẻ nhất, AI sẽ tự tìm kiếm, truy cập webiste, lọc sản phẩm theo giá và thêm vào giỏ hàng.\n",
            "\"Operator không làm tôi bối rối trước những câu hỏi, thay vào đó sẽ đề xuất dựa trên sở thích. Ngoài sản phẩm yêu cầu mua, nó còn đề xuất thêm các món khác để kết hợp giúp tạo ra nhiều món ăn hơn\", Turk cho biết.\n",
            "Operator cũng đề nghị \"cân nhắc can thiệp\" khi nhập tài khoản thanh toán, dù nó có thể \"chiếm quyền\" để đăng nhập tài khoản đã lưu. OpenAI cho biết Operator làm điều này là để tôn trọng quyền riêng tư và các thông tin nhạy cảm.\n",
            "Turk sau đó cũng yêu cầu Operator mua thêm cá và khoai tây chiên, đặt lịch làm móng, nhưng để nó chạy nền vì bà bận làm việc khác. Các thao tác được AI của OpenAI thực hiện trong chốc lát, gồm cả các khoản thanh toán trước.\n",
            " \n",
            "Tác nhân AI đang thay đổi cách tương tác trên Internet ra sao?\n",
            "Một số chức năng Operator có thể thực hiện. Video: Bảo Lâm tổng hợp\n",
            "Tuy nhiên, do vẫn ở giai đoạn thử nghiệm, không phải lúc nào Operator cũng theo ý người dùng. Casey Newton của Platformer cho biết đã thử đặt hàng ở cửa hàng tạp hóa Instacart. Ông mong đợi nó sẽ \"hỏi\" ông một số câu hỏi cơ bản như nơi sống, thường mua gì hay loại nào. AI này không hỏi điều gì, tự truy cập trình duyệt, mở website Instacart, tìm kiếm sữa ở Des Moines, Iowa thay vì nơi ông ở là San Francisco. Nó thậm chí nhập địa chỉ cửa hàng tạp hóa gần chỗ ông làm địa chỉ giao hàng. Ông buộc phải tự can thiệp để mua thứ mình muốn.\n",
            "\"Trải nghiệm cho thấy một trong những thiếu sót chính của Operator: nó có thể thao tác trên trình duyệt web, nhưng không dùng web đã được bạn cá nhân hóa\", Newton nói.\n",
            "Theo giới chuyên gia, hiện còn sớm để đánh giá AI Agent sẽ thay đổi cuộc sống của con người thế nào. Nhưng thông qua việc tương tác với trình duyệt và dịch vụ trực tuyến, nó sẽ sớm thay đổi cách một người tương tác trên Internet.\n",
            "\"Trước đây bạn chỉ hỏi và AI đưa ra câu trả lời, còn bây giờ bạn đưa ra một vấn đề và AI sẽ giải quyết vấn đề đó với những thứ nó có quyền truy cập\", Thomas Dohmke, CEO GitHub, giải thích trên blog. GitHub đã đưa Copilot dưới dạng AI Agent vào nền tảng của mình, nhưng cũng đang phát triển một sản phẩm với tính tự chủ cao hơn là Project Padawan, tự động thực hiện công việc theo lịch trình thay vì bị giám sát liên tục.\n",
            "Business Insider dẫn lời chuyên gia dự đoán trong tương lai, người dùng không cần truy cập website để đọc tin tức, bởi AI Agent đã làm thay. Nó cũng đề xuất, quyết định và hành động với bất cứ vấn đề gì thực hiện qua Internet, đem lại cho con người một cuộc sống có tổ chức hơn.\n",
            "Hai nhà phân tích Internet hàng đầu Mark Shmulik và Nikhil Devnani của công ty nghiên cứu Bernstein hình dung trong tương lai khi gọi xe, người dùng không bận tâm truy cập vào Uber, Lift hay Waymo mà chỉ muốn tìm chuyến đi nhanh, rẻ và thoải mái nhất. Tác nhân AI sẽ giúp họ thực hiện điều này.\n",
            "Theo hai chuyên gia, website và ứng dụng không biến mất, nhưng sẽ phải chuyển sang trạng thái mới để tương thích AI Agent, hiện được gọi là \"công cụ tổng hợp của tổng hợp nội dung\". Kết quả là, phần lớn cấu trúc Internet hiện tại sẽ thay đổi thời gian tới.\n",
            "Mặt trái của AI Agent\n",
            "\"Về lý thuyết, Tác nhân AI rất tuyệt vời vì tự động hóa rất nhiều công việc\", nhà khoa học Gary Marcus, người hoài nghi về các mô hình ngôn ngữ lớn (LLM), nói với Guardian. \"Nhưng tôi không nghĩ chúng sẽ hoạt động đáng tin cậy thời gian tới, và một phần do sự cường điệu liên quan đến chúng\".\n",
            "Càng có nhiều tác nhân tự chủ, rủi ro chúng gây ra càng lớn. Margaret Mitchell, CEO Hugging Face, cho rằng \"hoàn toàn tự chủ có nghĩa là quyền kiểm soát của con người được giao lại cho AI\". Thay vì hoạt động trong ranh giới đã đặt ra, một tác nhân hoàn toàn có thể truy cập những thứ \"nhạy cảm\" mà chủ nhân của chúng không nhận ra, hoặc hành xử theo cách không ngờ tới, nhất là khi chúng có thể tự viết code để thay đổi cấu trúc lệnh.\n",
            "\"Sẽ không có vấn đề lớn nếu AI Agent đặt sai đơn hàng, nhưng điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu nó chia sẻ thông tin cá nhân của bạn với website lừa đảo, hay đăng nội dung khủng khiếp trên mạng xã hội dưới tên của bạn?\", bà Mitchell đặt câu hỏi. \"Với nơi làm việc như chính phủ, nó có nguy cơ gây ra tình huống đặc biệt nguy hiểm, như có thể truy cập vào hệ thống chỉ huy tên lửa\".\n",
            "Mitchell khuyến cáo ngày càng nhiều thông tin có sẵn trên Internet không phải là ngôn ngữ của con người, mà là thông tin để Tác nhân AI có thể \"hành động\" trên đó. Bà kỳ vọng các chuyên gia công nghệ, nhà lập pháp và nhà hoạch định chính sách sớm đưa ra các quy định giảm thiểu những nguy cơ kể trên.\n",
            "Dohmke của GitHub cũng đồng tình với lo ngại này. Ông tin thời gian tới, trên các website, khái niệm \"Trang chủ\" sớm biến mất hoặc mất đi tầm quan trọng vì giao diện sẽ được thiết kế dành cho các AI Agent. Các thương hiệu có thể bắt đầu cạnh tranh để lôi kéo sự chú ý của AI là con người.\n",
            "\"Một ngày nào đó, AI Agent sẽ thoát khỏi sự giới hạn của máy tính. Chúng ta có thể thấy chúng trên robot hình người, mở ra khả năng hỗ trợ con người dưới dạng vật lý\", Dohmke nói. \"Chúng ta sẽ thấy robot AI giặt quần áo, rửa bát đĩa và làm bữa sáng. Chỉ cần không cho chúng tiếp cận vũ khí\".\n",

Contouring the learning rate over time is similar to contouring the speed of a car according to road conditions. On smooth, broad roads such as a highway, we can increase our speed (learning rate), but on narrow, hilly, or valley roads, we must slow down. Keep in mind that “...a high learning rate... [indicates] the system contains too much kinetic energy and the parameter vector bounces around chaotically, unable to settle down into the deeper, but narrower parts of the loss function” (see Karpathy’s Notes for cs231n). Such decay makes the learned network resistant to random fluctuations that could possibly reverse the learning. Learning rate decay\n",

            "Non-adaptive learning rates can be suboptimal. Learning rate decay can be brought about through reducing decay by some constant factor every few epochs, or by exponential decay, in which the decay takes a mathematical form of the exponential every few epochs. “Decay” is often considered a negative concept, and in the current case of learning rate decay it’s a negative, too: it refers to how much the learning rate is decreasing. In a car, for instance, we decrease the speed to suit the road and traffic conditions; this deacceleration can be understood as a “decay” in the velocity of the car. Think of a local minima as a speeding ticket, a toll or traffic light, or traffic congestion—something that basically increases the time taken to reach the destination. The RMSProp adaptive learning rate by Tieleman and Hinton, 2012, keeps a moving average of the squared gradient for each weight to normalize the current gradient.

Two different loss functions, the cross entropy and the classification error, are compared. When the learning rates are high, almost exponential jumps are seen (Learning rate 1 and .5). Each layer has a different fan-in or the number of inputs, that determines the overshoot effect caused by simultaneously updating the incoming weights of a unit aimed at correcting the same error (as is the case in the global learning rate). Hence, the appropriate learning rates can vary widely between weights. A fix for this issue involves setting a global learning rate and multiplying it by an appropriate local gain that is determined empirically for each weight. While using separate adaptive learning rates, either the entire batch should be used for learning, or larger mini-batches should be used in order to ensure the changes in the signs of the gradients are not mainly due to the sampling error of a mini-batch or random fluctuations. These per-weight adaptive learning rates can also be combined with momentum. As the network is pretrained, fine-tuning takes considerably less time to train, because the network has already acquired most of the information it needs and must only refine that knowledge during the fine-tuning phase.

We can always find a pre-trained model for the application we are developing, selectively add or delete parts of it, and ultimately fine-tune it for the application we need. And, if we contour our learning rate accurately, we reach our destination in good time.\n",

If you have backups, but you haven't tested restoring them, you don't really have backups. Testing doesn't just mean knowing you can get the data back; it means knowing how to put it back into the database, how to handle incremental changes, how to reinstall the whole thing if you need to.

What are the most common mistakes people make when planning their backup systems strategy? If you have backups, but you haven't tested restoring them, you don't really have backups. Testing doesn't just mean knowing you can get the data back; it means knowing how to put it back into the database, how to handle incremental changes, how to reinstall the whole thing if you need to. It's the sort of thing that people will cut corners on if they're busy. It's worth taking the time to make it as simple and painless and automated as possible; never rely on human willpower for anything! to transfer and reinsert the data. When you build the second one, it's hard to be sure it's exactly the same. The only way to be sure you've covered everything is to fail over in earnest. But there can still be some forgotten components of the system that only run in one or two places. Parts of the system that are only used in disasters need the most testing, or they'll fail you when you need them. But someone needs to keep a big picture of what depends on what, because it can get very tangled very fast. You can even end up with things that indirectly depend on themselves—for example, a device that you need to configure to bring up the network, but you can't get to it while the network is down. Why is this important and what’s your advice for doing it effectively? The other advantage of starting early is that you can split up your services into vertical \"strata,\" where the functionality in each stratum must be able to come completely online before the next one begins.

Describe your design process and an example of the impact it’s had on business outcomes at Shopify. The floor plan is pretty much a representation of our roadmap. Also, every project has a multidisciplinary trio of leads (product, engineering, and UX). They make decisions together, and ensure a good team alignment. Second, we often start the design process with a design sprint, inspired by Google Ventures. A lot of effort goes into tweaking our processes so they work for the project, people, and product. This seems quite obvious, but I know from experience that surprisingly few UX professionals ever get to meet their users. To use a biology reference: designers and developers are not in a neutral relationship (where both entities simply live together), but rather a mutualist association (where they benefit from each other). We might think that error management is not as important as other pieces of the interface. 4. If you’re a designer, invite developers to your design feedback sessions and vice versa.

In the past years, however, breakthroughs in AI and deep learning have changed everything in the quest for speech recognition. Applying deep learning techniques enabled remarkable results. Today, we see the leap forward in development manifesting in a wide range of products, such as Amazon Echo, Apple Siri, and many more. In this post, I’ll review recent advances in speech recognition, examine the elements that have contributed to the rapid progress, and discuss the futureand how far we may be from solving the problem completely.

In conversational AI, machine perception includes all speech analysis technologies, such as recognition and profiling, and machine cognition includes all the language understanding-related technologies, which are part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, before 2011 and the advent of deep learning, big data, and cloud computing, these solutions were far from sufficient for mass adoptions and commercial use. Together with more data, available cloud computing, and adoption from big companies like Apple (SIRI), Amazon (Alexa), and Google, there were significant improvements in the performance and the products released to the market.

            "The past six years of speech recognition has created more breakthroughs then the previous 40+ years. In order to understand the impact of deep learning and the part it plays, we need to understand first how speech recognition works. Although speech recognition has been in active research for almost 50 years, building machines that understand human speech is one of the most challenging problems in AI. This level is very similar to every machine learning task; in other words, given some data, we need to do proper data pre-processing and feature extraction. The impact is so far-reaching that even today, almost every solution in the field of speech recognition probably has one or more neural-based algorithms embedded within it. Usually the evaluation of speech recognition systems is based on an industry standard called Switchboard (SWBD). The evaluation of a speech recognition system is based on a metric called word error rate (WER). WER refers to how many words are misrecognized by the speech recognition system. Source: Yishay Carmiel. This development was a game changer for speech recognition, an almost 77% relative improvement. Now there are a wide range of applications, such as Apple SIRI, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, and Google Now. Unfortunately, there isn’t a single method. Deep learning and speech recognition are so entangled that creating a state-of-the-art system involves a variety of different techniques and methods. Figure 4. Source: Yishay Carmiel. Creating a state-of-the-art system is not an easy task, and building it involves implementing and integrating all these different techniques into the system. Dealing with distant speech is a challenging problem that is being actively researched by a lot of groups. Generating synthesized data and training systems based on that is getting good attention today. Scalability\n",

            "Since deep learning is so entangled with speech recognition, it consumes a non-trivial amount of CPU and memory. As a result, there is research toward edge speech recognition that preserves the quality of a cloud-based system. The first problem is the issue of sensitivity to noise. A speech recognition system works pretty well from a close microphone and non-noisy environment; however, distant speech and noisy data degrades the system rapidly. Scaling the systems poses a tremendous challenge. In addition, we lack data on many languages, and a speech recognition system is difficult to create with low data resources. Or is a new solution waiting to be discovered? After all, the recent advances in speech recognition are just one piece of the puzzle: language understanding itself is a complex mystery—maybe an even greater one.\n",

She ended up building the world’s largest online, preclinical pathology database, which catalyzes and could ultimately lead to the automated detection of cancer. The most common stain, H&E, is a mixture of an acidic dye (hematoxylin) and a basic one (eosin), which will stain cytoplasm pink and nuclei purple. But there are hundreds of “special stains” to detect tissue elements (e.g., muscle fibers, glycoproteins, and mucins), microorganisms (e.g., fungi and bacilli), or specific ions like ferric iron (Fe3+). While standard H&E staining is automated, using special stains or IHC can take significant time to optimize. When Ke founded HistoWiz four years ago, there were already instruments available that would automate histopathology (though they were uncommon to see in everyday research labs). Ke was inspired by the open source genomic research model, in which searchable databases exist that everyone can access and contribute to. An H&E stained slide of metastatic murine lung cancer, available in HistoWiz’ demo slide gallery. Ke’s mission is to “fight cancer cooperatively.” No more slide boxes or static representative images—this database allows researchers to do tissue-driven data mining by using whole slides in a massive dataset. And last but not least, the moonshot. This approach would be cheaper and faster than current methods (genetic sequencing, for example). Different users will have different levels to help distinguish tags from the in-house pathologists, versus the slide owner, versus the general public.

Data integration is often a painstaking, highly manual process of matching fields and resolving entities, but new tools can work alongside human experts to discover patterns in data and make recommendations for automatically merging it. Knudsen points to Andrew Ng’s assessment that “if a typical person can do a mental task with less than two seconds of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future.” AI-driven products that make more complex judgments need to acknowledge their limitations and invite humans into the loop.\n",

            "Gathering, preparing, and enriching the right data—particularly training data—is essential and remains a key bottleneck among companies wanting to use machine learning. In RL, the goal is to learn how to map observations and measurements to a set of actions, while trying to maximize some long-term reward. Ray allows users to run simulations in parallel and comes with a Python API that makes it accessible for data scientists (Ray itself is written mainly in C++). Its creators have made it simple for others to use Python to write and run their own algorithms on top of Ray, including regular machine learning models. Why do you need a machine learning library and what algorithms are important for continuous learning? Recall that in RL one needs to learn how to map observations and measurements to a set of actions, while trying to maximize some long-term reward. Recent RL success stories mainly use gradient-based deep learning for this, but researchers have found that other optimization strategies such as evolution can be helpful. Unlike supervised learning where you start with training data and a target objective, in RL one only has sparse feedback, so techniques like neuroevolution become competitive with classic gradient descent. There are also other related algorithms that might become part of the standard collection of models used for continuous learning (e.g., counterfactual regret minimization used recently for poker). Most companies are still in the process of learning how to use and deploy standard (offline) machine learning, so perhaps discussing continuous learning is premature. As with any other new method or technology, the starting point is to identify uses cases where continuous learning potentially provides an advantage over existing offline approaches. The set of companies already using bandit algorithms (to recommend content or evaluate products) can probably quickly identify use cases and become early adopters. Companies are realizing that in many settings machine learning models start degrading soon after they get deployed to production.\n",

Joseph and Robert will be presenting a session on Event Sourcing at Global Scale at Netflix at O’Reilly Velocity Conference, taking place October 1-4 in New York. The primary challenge when operating a service in a distributed architecture at scale is managing for the behavior of your downstream dependencies. Whether those dependencies are a datastore or a restful API defining timeouts, fallback data, and concurrency of the interactions will be the defining factor of your service. Your service may scale wonderfully, but if a dependency is not accounted for then the overall service can quickly fall over.Continue reading Building—and scaling—a reliable distributed architecture.\n",

To allow for greater flexibility, I will then describe how to build a class of reinforcement learning agents, which can optimize for various goals called “direct future prediction” (DFP).

If we want our drone to learn to deliver packages, we simply provide a positive reward of +1 for successfully flying to a marked location and making a delivery.

            "Much of the current excitement in AI and data science is about generating information and modeling knowledge. Classification tools—which is where machine learning really excels—generate new information. Natural language processing tools can summarize text and tell us how the writer felt about the subject.

            "Beyond the classification or procedural knowledge available with neural networks and deep learning, lies the realm of wisdom—the deep experiential insight where one not only knows what a thing is, but also knows why, and in what context. Wisdom allows one to be reminded of things: that new thing “rings a bell,” it is like this other thing I already know… and here’s why I think so. This is where artificial intelligence is heading. The future of work enhanced by data will enable us to focus on higher-level tasks. Logging error reports are meaningless if the logs are never looked at, and the information generated by a search engine or a classification model can’t become knowledge if it is never used. We build data systems and AI tools to support human needs, and we will always need humans to turn the potential insights provided by technology into real value. It is humans who build, operate, and understand the tools that turn data into information, and information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom. Those people bridging the gap between computer data and human wisdom will fill a variety of roles from executive leadership to low-level analyst.\n",

I recently caught up with Silge and Robinson to discuss how they’re using text mining on job postings at Stack Overflow, some of the challenges and best practices they’ve experienced when mining text, and how their tidytext package for R aims to make text analysis both easy and informative. Why did you create the tidytext text mining package in R? We created the tidytext package because we believe in the power of tidy data principles, and we wanted to apply this consistent, opinionated approach for handling data to text mining tasks. Tidy tools like dplyr and ggplot2 are widely used, and integrating natural language processing into these tools allows R users to work with greater fluency. A word like “share” has a positive meaning in most contexts, but is neutral in financial contexts, where it usually refers to shares of stock. Applying the Loughran-McDonald lexicon allows us to explore the sentiment content of documents dealing with finance with more confidence. One example we deal with is text in job postings; we use text mining and modeling to match job listings with people who may be interested in them. Data scientists and analysts like us are usually trained on numerical data in a rectangular shape like a table (i.e., data frame), so it takes some practice to fluently wrangle raw text data. When your data is tidy, you can use a common set of tools for exploring and visualizing them. Using consistent tools designed for handling tidy data gives us a dependable framework for understanding how to represent text data in R, visualize the characteristics of text, model topics, and move smoothly to more complex machine learning applications. What is the difference between text mining and natural language processing? We describe our work as “text mining” because our goal is extracting and visualizing insights, but there is a great deal of overlap.\n",
